Tableau analysis

Story pane #1 
	* From the pie chart we can see that females generated nearly 75% of bike trips in 2019
	* Females subscribers also outnumbered male subscribers 3 to 1
	* However, male and unknown customers (1 time users) equaled female identified customers in frequency of trips
	* The average age of our male and female users were roughly the same
	* Our customers who didn't identify themselves skewed much older than our other users, by 10-20 years
Story pane #2
	* Customers represent only a fraction of bike trips compared to subcribers
	* However, customer biking hours are 1/3 of total hours because the duration of their trips are significantly longer than subscribers
	* So, looking at these 2 dashboards, we can say that females do drive biking hours, but not as much as subscriber counts alone would have led us to believe
	* While customer ride counts are much lower than subscriber ride counts, they consume much more bike time than subscriber rides on a per ride basis.  
	* Based on story pane #1, we have a large segment of customers that we know skew older, who are renting our bicycles as one-offs that generating a lot of bike hours
	* We would do well to find out more about this customer segment as they are likely a revenue generator and a segment that we would like to grow more.  

	* Another take away from this story is that we should focus on subscriber growth on the male segment of the population, given their lag to the female cohort.  

	
Story pane #3
	* The most popular stations have ridership that skews olders according to this bubble chart
	* This suggests that their is untapped potential with the younger demographic that we need to focus on if we want to expand our reach
